				“If you look at the statistics for single-player games, the majority of players do not finish them. That’s a
				storytelling problem,” she says. <a href = "http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/08/17/finishing.videogames.snow/">Raptr estimated</a> that only one in 10 players completed the final mission in the original
				Red Dead Redemption.

			<h3>Story Scripting</h3>
			<div class = "text-alt">
				Find a start point,
				Once you have decided what the style of your game is decide on a genre,.
				Look at other pieces of work in that genre like if it was horror you watch horror movies and read horror books.
				Create a character list. 3 stages to the list.
				Start - how do you want your characters to start out, what are their goals, morals, emotions, what is the purpose of the
				game?
				Middle - your characters are progressing, getting stronger, learning and developing and growing, how does this affect
				their morals, emotions?
				end - your characters should be fully developed (unless you have a sequel) they should be grown, and able to make
				decisions on their own, perhaps even have lost one of the other characters along the way, thus perhaps damaging them?
				Character development is very important in a good game, if a character doesn't develop then the game gets boring very
				quickly.

				“A game is as good as its plot twists” - Bill Gates.
				Portal’s cake
				Heavy Rain killer
				Alice in Detroit
				Spiderman Ending
				COD 4: Modern Warfare
				<br>
				You have to have a couple of good plot twist in a game to shock players and keep them entertained.
				<br>
				You keep adding little bits to the story to fill it up, although everything should contribute to either character
				development or story progression.

			<h3>One Final Tip</h3>
			<div class="text-alt">
				One final tip. DO NOT USE story generators. Here are some examples why you shouldn’t use them.
				<br>
				When a Jedi from Porto Alegre learns to make tissue paper flowers, not everybody is supportive. However, his fortunes
				improve when his tutor becomes a vet. The Jedi realises he's actually a ghost.
				<br>
				When a fairy from Bolton decides to rob a bank, not everybody is supportive. However, her fortunes improve when her best
				friend buys a set of earplugs. It turns out the whole plot was a practical joke.
