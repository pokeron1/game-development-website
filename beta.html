				Beta-testing is when a product is sent out to be tested before launch. These products are varied - they can be hardware or software - but beta-testing is
				often considered to be for software. The process is considered to be a way to see how the product fares in a realistic environment, outside of the creator's
				own conditions. The beta-testing stage is one of the final stages before the product's launch and typically lasts between four and eight weeks.

				Beta-testers are tasked with using the product before the official release. This is why they are called <i>beta-testers</i>; they test the beta version of the 
				product. The main purpose of this is to iron out any bugs/flaws that are still present in the product, ensuring that the final version is of maximum quality.
				The testers send reports to the developers, often through an official forum. The reports must be detailed so the developers can find the bug quickly and
				easily; the reports include tha place and situation with images being recommended.
			</div>
	
			<div class = "text-alt">
				Feature requests are a second priority for the beta-testers. They help developers make the product more appealing to their audience. For less detailed 
				feedback, surveys or polls are used. As for feedback required by the developers, specific tasks are set out for testers to complete. These allow the developers 
				to test all parts of the product, even parts that would not normally be considered by the users.

			<h3 class = "gradient-text">Why is it So Important?</h3>
			<div class = "text">
				Beta-testing is often considered to be an incredible important stage of the product's development. After all, it is where the developers can see how the
				product functions in the environment it is designed for. Without this stage, the final product runs the risk of being unsuitable for public usage. While
				this can be fixed with software, hardware cannot be fixed after release - it is already on the shelves, after all. And while software can be fixed, the
				users would not use the product due to the issues; an update would not make them return if they have already chosen an alternative.
			</div>
	
			<div class = "text">
				At the end of the day, the purpose of beta-testing is to improve the customer experience. This is why all the bugs are ironed out with new features being
				requested. After all, the customer may choose a better option, whether it is because it has better features or functions better. Beta-testing greatly
				decreases the chances of this happening.
